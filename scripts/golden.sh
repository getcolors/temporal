# Green's regression net against the committed goldens: render every fixture
# and diff against committed output. scripts/parity.sh is the net across
# colours.
#
# Two fixtures, one per keypair mode of the one advertised compute provider,
# because the SSH Keypair Standard has two modes and a package conforms only if
# both hold. `colors.yml` is opt-out mode: it supplies an explicit key id and a
# name equal to the profile and must render the historical shape byte for
# byte, creating no key resource — that tree is the shape a temporal
# deployment's state holds, so a change there is a plan against its machine.
# `keygen.yml` carries no `digitalocean-ssh-keys` and no `digitalocean-name`:
# the compute template must declare the profile-named key resource and
# reference it by attribute.
#
# Keygen paths are rendered from a fixed placeholder home on :build, never from
# $HOME, so these goldens mean the same thing on every workstation.
#
#   ./scripts/golden.sh            check
#   ./scripts/golden.sh --accept   regenerate after an intended change
