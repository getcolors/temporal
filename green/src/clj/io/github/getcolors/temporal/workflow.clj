  backend fails loudly -- swallowing it is how a live teardown ended up
  converging against 192.0.2.10. What this package adds is the address
  override: an explicit :ip (COLORS_PAR_IP) never skips the read or the
  provider guard, it only replaces the cleanup address once the read has
  succeeded, for a state whose recorded address is stale. ONCE deliberately
  applies no such override, so no other package gains a way to point a
  delete's cleanup at an arbitrary host."
